# My-Python-Programs
This repository contains the Python Programs I've built.

<b>Programs in this repository:</b>
<ol>
<li><b>CollatzConjecture </b> - This program starts with a number > 1 given by the user. The program then finds the number of steps it takes to reach 1 using the following process: If the number is even, divide it by 2. If the number is odd, multiply it by 3 then add 1. This was a challenge I found online and decided to recreate.</li>
  <li><b>EmployeeCostCalculator</b> - This program reads in a file containing randomly generated employee information. (first name, last name, job title, and salary) The program then prints all the employees out to the console so the user can see them. After printing the employee information, the program then calculates the total cost of each category of employee. (entry level, associate level, senior level, and expert level) After calculations are done, the totals are printed to the console.</li>
  <li><b>BasicCalculator</b> - This is a console calculator that does basic mathematical functions. (addition, subtraction, multiplication and division)</li>
  <li><b>PythonCalculatorGUI</b> - A basic calculator GUI. This is to showcase my understanding of the basics of creating GUIs using Python.<br><b>Issues that are still being worked out:</b> - <ol>
    <li>Cannot create equations with two numbers that have decimals - Still working on the logic.</li>
    </ol></li>
</ol>
